"""Strong prime generation.
A prime number p is a strong prime if (p - 1) / 2 is also a prime number.

Additionally, for Diffie-Hellman, p must be at least 1024 bits.
This is accomplished using a random range function with
lower and upper bounds, respectively:
 - the smallest 1024-bit integer, 2^1023, and
 - 1 + the largest 2048-bit integer, 2^2048 (this bound is exclusive).

Let q = (p - 1) / 2 such that p = 2q + 1.
Since q is also a prime number, it is odd and can be represented as
2k + 1 for some integer k.

The bounds for the random range function can be adjusted so that
we do not generate p and then determine if both it and q are odd numbers,
but generate k and guarantee q = 2k + 1 is odd, as well as 2q + 1.

If a = 2^1023 and b = 2^2048, then a <= p < b.
-> a <= 2q + 1 < b
-> a <= 2(2k + 1) + 1 < b
-> a <= 4k + 3 < b
-> (a - 3) / 4 <= k < (b - 3) / 4
So the new bounds a' and b' are (a - 3) / 4 and (b - 3) / 4, respectively.
